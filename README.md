Deep and classical learning of a cubic oscillator.  
Deep learning TensorFlow heavily relies on the code provided by Samuel H. Rudy, J. Nathan Kutz and Steven L. Brunton in "Deep learning of dynamics and signal-noise decomposition with time-stepping constraints", see https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02578. More comments added  
In Deep learning Keras, a change from the TensorFlow framework to Keras was attempted.  
Additionally, a parameter estimation procedure via Kalman Filteration has been implemented for comparision.
